# ADR-065: Retire legacy CTF notification writes

Status: accepted, 2026-09-19. Decision owner: @Brad-Edwards. Issue: #2100.

The maintainer explicitly chose retirement of legacy notification writes and the
new scoped communication routes. This is the separately accepted ADR-040
exception for the complete legacy write capability. Historical reads remain
available. No compatibility write may keep broad event-scope dispatch or return
`sent` for ledger acceptance. Retired HTTP operations return a bounded 410;
their exact paths/methods are recorded in `openapi/v1.retirements.json`.

Cutover requires maintenance downtime. Stop and drain all old web, scheduler,
and asynchronous email processes before recording the fence. A database lock
cannot recall external mail or prove that an old process has exited. The
maintenance command refuses unresolved `SENDING` notifications and `RUNNING`
jobs. PostgreSQL triggers enforce the durable fence against old notification
inserts/updates and every scheduler claim. New claim transactions identify the
ledger writer version and require activated cutover; old binaries cannot claim
lifecycle or provisioning tasks that could invoke legacy notification callbacks.
The version is transaction-local and cannot authorize a later connection user. Never roll
back to an old sending binary or reverse the fence migration: restore or repair
forward with the same writer ownership.

Conversion uses bounded transactions and a stable old-row mapping. Invalid
content, missing authority/scope, ambiguous task ownership, unsupported targeting,
and orphaned work block activation with bounded diagnostics. Historical counters
stay on the legacy aggregate; no successful recipients or read/ack receipts are
inferred. Pending email declarations retain their channel and due time but no
runnable delivery work while #1525 is unavailable. Explicit dependency recovery
uses the same mapped campaign and occurrence key. No silent substitution of
in-app delivery is permitted.

Non-secret participant notices use the ledger. Password issuance remains
volatile at its existing credential owner. Organizer-only legacy email alerts
are unavailable until a supported recipient/transport contract exists; the
participant ledger must not gain invented organizer participants or disclose
organizer-only material to participants.

Revision R4, 2026-10-30, issue #528. The maintainer chose the organizer
recipient contract. The existing ledger gains an explicit organizer recipient
kind with principal identity and recipient-kind database constraints. The event
owner and live co-organizers are delivery candidates, not authority. Release,
the delivery worker and the organizer inbox recheck the candidate set and
current native policy. Organizer alerts use the in-app organizer inbox, and
email when the deployment has email delivery. Organizer rows never enter the
participant inbox, the communications console or campaign reports. Only the
system origin can select organizer recipients. The
[design](../architecture/ctf-organizer-alerts-design-528.md) and the
[preflight](../architecture/ctf-organizer-alerts-preflight-528.md) give the
details. ADR-071 provides the email transport.

Revision R5, 2026-10-31, issue #664. The maintainer chose these rules for
participant lifecycle notices. Registration, range-ready and range-failure
notices are durable declarations in the transaction that causes them. Each
declaration is one system campaign for one participant occurrence, with a
stable identity. Every seat-creation path declares a registration confirmation
for a seat with a delivery email. These declarations skip the shared system
authoring rate budget, as organizer alerts do. Seat creation and range status
bound their number. Release-time admission backpressure still applies. The
[design](../architecture/ctf-participant-notices-design-664.md) gives the details.

Revision R6, 2026-10-31, issue #662. The maintainer chose a durable
cancellation notice on this ledger. The cancel transaction declares one
`cancellation` notice for the event, after task cancellation and the
communication fence. A scheduled release task releases it and retries on
backpressure. This notice is the only exception to the ADR-051-R6
cancelled-event release and delivery fence. The exception needs the
`system_milestone` origin, the immutable `cancellation` kind and exactly one
cancelled target event. Only the system campaign factory can set that kind, and
only for a cancelled event. Campaign and intent cancellation, recipient
revocation, tenancy and retention still apply. A notice failure does not block
cancellation or range cleanup. The
[design](../architecture/ctf-cancellation-notice-design-662.md) and the
[preflight](../design/ctf-event-cancellation-preflight-706.md) give the
details.

The API compatibility checker supports exact absent write-method retirements so
retaining GET on the same URL does not exempt it from compatibility checking.
Reintroducing any retired method fails the checker. All unrelated differences
remain subject to the pinned compatibility oracle.
